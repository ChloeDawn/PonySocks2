This is the GitHub repository for PonySocks.

## Compiling

Compiling this is a bit tricky.

1. Create a "libs" directory.
2. Clone [the MineLittlePony repository](https://github.com/MineLittlePony/MineLittlePony/).
3. Run "gradle build"
4. Copy the "-srg.jar" to "libs" and deobfuscate using BON2.
5. From here on, create your workspace as usual.
